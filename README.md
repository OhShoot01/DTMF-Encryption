# DTMF Encryption

Currently UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This project aims to transmit text messages using DTMF tones encrypted using a dynamic key. These tones will be transmitted using PMR446 radios (no HAM licence required) and will provide a legal and secure off-the-grid method of communication.

Right now the system is made up of two python scripts (one for encryption and the other for decryption).
In the future, they will be unified and a graphical GUI will be added.

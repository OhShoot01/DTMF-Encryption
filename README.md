# DTMF Encryption

Currently UNDER DEVELOPMENT

This project aims to transmit text messages using DTMF tones encrypted using a dynamic key. These tones will be transmitted using PMR446 radios (no HAM licence required) and will provide a legal and secure off-grid method of communication.

Currently, the program is made up of two python scripts (one for encryption and the other for decryption).
In the future, they will be unified and a graphical UI will be added.
